# Intel® RealSense™ plugin for opentrack
This is a tracker providing markerless 3D head tracking using the Intel® RealSense™ SDK and the Intel® RealSense™ front-facing cameras. 

More information on RealSense can be found on [Intel.com](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/realsense-overview.html)

This tracker uses a separate library that gets data from the SDK. Its sources are under rs_impl and can be recompiled by calling build.bat, which depends on Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler and the [Intel® RealSense™ SDK 2016 R3](http://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/vcp/9078/intel_rs_sdk_offline_package_10.0.26.0396.exe)
